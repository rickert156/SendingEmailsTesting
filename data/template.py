Hi Asheesh Malaney,

I’m Vlad, and I lead a dedicated development team at Digital Octane. I came across FundWA on a list of top VC and Private Equity firms and wanted to connect.

We frequently collaborate with VC and Private Equity firms, assisting them with development work for the startups they support. Our team has extensive experience working directly with startups and through agencies or VC firms, consistently delivering high-quality results at a fraction of the usual cost.

Our established team of developers, QA specialists, and project managers can handle all your development needs, whether for long-term support or a quick project. We’re proficient in PHP (various frameworks), JavaScript, React, React Native, NodeJS, WordPress, Shopify, and more.

Every project undergoes QA to ensure solid results. With team members in multiple time zones, including Los Angeles and Dubai, we can quickly step in whenever needed.

If you’re seeking extra support for current projects or planning something new, I’d be happy to discuss the details. Partnering with us can help you save both time and budget while ensuring top-notch results.

Please feel free to let me know a convenient time for a call.

Best regards,
Vlad
Digital Octane
